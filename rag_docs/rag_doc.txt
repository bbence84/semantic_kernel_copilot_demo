Deep learning
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.

Large language model
A large language model (LLM) is a language model notable for its ability to achieve general-purpose language generation and other natural language processing tasks such as classification. LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process. LLMs can be used for text generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word.

Machine learning
Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.

Uses and applictions of AI in enterprise software
AI is showing up in software for various business functions, including sales, marketing, HR, finance, and operations. For instance, AI integrated into analytics software is quickly providing real-time insights into market trends, customer behavior, and supply chain dynamics. In addition, natural language processing, ML, predictive analytics, and more now automate routine tasks, optimize business processes, and enhance decision-making.
The transformative potential of AI extends to enabling entirely new business models and avenues for innovation. For example, AI added to pricing software could enable prices to adjust in real-time based on demand, competition, and customer profiles. In healthcare, AI could put the “personal” in personalized medicine, where treatments and medications are optimized based on an individual's genetic makeup, socioeconomic factors, and geographical location. In capital markets, the combination of AI and quantum computing has the potential to upend financial modeling by performing complex risk analysis and portfolio optimization.

Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an interdisciplinary area of machine learning and optimal control concerned with how an intelligent agent ought to take actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize the cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
